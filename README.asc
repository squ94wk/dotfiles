= Squ94wk's dotfiles

This repo is the home of my ~.
My dotfiles currently contain configuration for zsh, vim and tmux.
I'm not using `oh-my-zsh` (anymore), because of bloat and for the purpose of learning.

The format is designed to be portable and easy to manage.

== Installation

If you're interested in checking out (install) my dotfiles, run:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/squ94wk/9cf511ed322ecb8e601e798c19d9e6ef/raw)
```

Check out the to link:https://gist.githubusercontent.com/squ94wk/9cf511ed322ecb8e601e798c19d9e6ef[gist].
In case you wanna go back, there's a backup made as the `dotfiles.backup.tar` file.
So just

 tar xf dotfiles.backup.tar

to restore.


== Manual installation:

The dotfiles are designed as a repository under `${HOME}/.dotfiles` with its working tree being `${HOME}` itself. Only the desired files are tracked.
An alias `dotfiles` functions as a `git` wrapper and is used to manage the state of the files under VCS.

Check out the source code for more details.
